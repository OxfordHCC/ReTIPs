# PETRAS ReTiPS - Respectful Things in Private Spaces

This is the repository for code, data and tools produced as part of the [Respectful Things in Private Spaces (ReTiPS) project](https://www.petrashub.org/portfolio-item/respectful-things-in-private-spaces-investigating-ethical-data-handling-for-very-personal-devices-retips/), which is funded by the [PETRAS Internet of Things Research Hub](https://www.petrashub.org).

## Deliverables

### Deliverables 1-4

Deliverables 1-4 are detailed in the 6 month report.

### Deliverable 5: Data Flow Models for Smart Home Devices

We examined a variety of smart home devices to identify the destinations, frequency and nature of any data flows from the device to first and third party sources, which can be found in the [Deliverable 5 folder](D5)

### Deliverable 6 & 7: Decision Support Tools

Using the data flow models derived in D5, we created a set of decision support tools to help users understand the privacy implications of their existing devices and new potential devices they might integrate into their home. See [delivable 6 folder](D6-7)
