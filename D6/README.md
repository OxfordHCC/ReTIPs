# Deliverable 6

In order to provide end-users with detailed oversight of the data exposure from their smart home, we used the models derived from D5 to create an interactive visualisation of these data flows.

This has been designed to run live in a smart home. For the purposes of demonstration, a static version of this tool is available [here](https://github.com/DKarandikar/XrayIoTAnalysis/tree/master/AutomatedCapture).

This could be used to provide the user with situational awareness of the data exposure resulting from various smart home projects. In collaboration with the [Buildings Research Institute](www.bre.co.uk), we will be installing and testing this system in [Integer House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTEGER_Millennium_House), a demonstration smart home.
