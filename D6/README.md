# Deliverables 6 & 7

In order to provide end-users with detailed oversight of the data exposure from their smart home, we used the models derived from D5 to create interactive visualisations of these data flows.

These serve two purposes:

* Decision support systems for selecting new IoT devices to install in the home. (D6)

* Enabling end-users to establish ongoing situational awareness, monitoring and intervention in the face of changes in their information environment as a result of the IoT devices present in their homes. (D7)

Our system has been designed to run either statically, providing an overview of the data flows associated with a device (D6), or to run dynamically, live in a smart home (D7). For the purposes of demonstration, we have a [static version](https://dkarandikar.github.io/StaticRefine/), and [code](https://github.com/DKarandikar/XrayIoTAnalysis/tree/master/AutomatedCapture).

This could be used to provide the user with situational awareness of the data exposure resulting from various smart home projects. In collaboration with the [Buildings Research Institute](www.bre.co.uk), we will be installing and testing this system in [Integer House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTEGER_Millennium_House), a demonstration smart home.
